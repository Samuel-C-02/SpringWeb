# SpringWeb Project

SpringWeb is a Java-based application built with the Spring Boot framework, utilizing best practices and popular Spring technologies and libraries.<br> It provides a RESTful API for efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, along with solutions to common problems encountered in web application development.

## Technologies and libraries used:
- **Spring Data:** Currently utilizing JPA for flexible database querying, including native queries, JPQL, and Projections.
- **Spring Starter Web (Jackson):** Facilitating the handling of JSON data within the API.
- **MapStruct:** Simplifying and reducing the verbosity of DTOs and entity mapping.
- **Lombok:** Reducing code verbosity by automating boilerplate code.
- **Logback-SLF4J:** Customizing logging configurations through XML for improved readability and preparation for logging to file if necessary.
- **Swagger UI:** Providing a graphical interface for exploring and testing the API endpoints.
- **Spring Starter Test (JUnit, Mockito):** Creation of Unit tests (TODO).

## Planned future enhancements:
- **Spring Security and JWT management:** Implementing authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- **Utilization of JPA Specification for grid management:** Dynamically defining complex search queries.
- **Spring Actuator, Spring Batch, Spring AOP:** Exploring potential integrations for improved application functionality.
- **Docker:** Introducing Docker to simplify deployment using images running on containers with Docker Compose.
